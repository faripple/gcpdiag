  Stackdriver Logging is enabled in the cluster
---

**Product**: [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Enabling stackdriver logging for your dataproc cluster impacts the ability to troubleshoot any issues that you might have.

If you are a Google Cloud Support customer, keeping system logging and monitoring enabled is important even if you have your own monitoring solution, because otherwise the support team wonâ€™t have access to logs and monitoring data used for troubleshooting. This is the more relevant when creating ephemeral clusters.

### Remediation

dataproc.logging.stackdriver.enable is enabled by default when a cluster is created. If you disabled this during cluster creation by setting the above property to false, please create create a new clsuter without this property.
